2. Open and adapt local-script.sh
3. Run local-script.sh
4. Open and adapt server-script.sh then copy to server
5. Install web server (e.g. nginx)
6. Create folder on server "/var/www/your_project_name"
7. For nginx case rename, adapt and copy to server file "your_project_name" in "/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/" folder
8. Rename and adapt your_project_name.service then copy to server in service folder (e.g. "/etc/systemd/system/")
9. Install proper version of dotnet on server
10. Run second and third commands from server-script.sh
11. Enable service on boot up run by command "systemctl enable your_project_name"
12. Run service by command "systemctl start your_project_name"
